# Challenge 09 - Readme Generator

## Description

This weeks challenge is to create a CLI in node.js (using the inquirer package) that generates a readme file. When users start up the CLI they will be asked a series of questions about their application. Those answers will be used to populate a professional looking readme file with a relevant name.

## Installation and Deployment

This application is not deployed nor hosted and there is no one way for other users to install it. For demonstration purposes, functionality can be viewed in the section below.
